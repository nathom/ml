  "What was the cause of this movement by what laws was it governed ",
  "For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are made by generals as anyone of us sitting over a map in his study may imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle the questions present themselves Why did Kut\u00fazov during the retreat not do this or that ",

  "Why did he not retire at once by the Kal\u00faga road abandoning Moscow ",
  "When had that question been settled ?",

  "Is it better to give up Moscow without a battle or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well as Moscow ",
  "When he had dismissed the generals Kut\u00fazov sat a long time with his elbows on the table thinking always of the same terrible question When when did the abandonment of Moscow become inevitable ",
  "When was that done which settled the matter ?",
  "And who was to blame for it ?",
  "Why did they go ",
  "What right have you monseigneur to demand an account of my attachments and friendships ",
  "What have they been invented for if they cant arrange that ",
  "And with this aim in one of her talks with her Father Confessor she insisted on an answer to the question in how far was she bound by her marriage ",
  "What did you commit by so acting ?",
  "A venial or a mortal sin ",
  "Perhaps you think you have invented a novelty ?",
  "Which of the two ",
  "But tell me how will your husband look at the matter ",
  "Will he agree ",
  "Even divorce you ",

  "Well what does that lead up to ",
  "Told whom ",
  "Why are you here ",
  "Why ",

  "And what position will you adopt toward the government ",
  "Why ",
  "Did the Tugendbund which saved Europe they did not then venture to suggest that Russia had saved Europe do any harm ?",
  "What are you writing Mary ",
  "A diary ",
  "What is a ticket ",
  "The radiant eyes gazed at him questioningly would he approve or disapprove of her diary ",
  "Have you any idea why he went to Petersburg ",
  "A pity you were not there what would you have said ",

  "What business was it of mine when I married and was so deep in debt that I was threatened with prison and had a mother who could not see or understand it ",

  "Have you done this ",
  "Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me ",
  "Are you ill ",

  "The question how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided ?",
  "What does all this mean ?",
  "Why did it happen ",
  "What made those people burn houses and slay their fellow men ?",
  "What were the causes of these events ",
  "What force made men act so ",
  "Modern history replying to these questions says you want to know what this movement means what caused it and what force produced these events ",
  "If the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of humanity and of the peoples the first question in the absence of a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible is what is the power that moves peoples ",
  "CHAPTER II  What force moves the nations ",
  "The historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their progenitors the writers of universal histories for if historical events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one another in such and such ways why not explain them by the fact that such and such people wrote such and such books ?",
  "Someone asks What moves it ",
  "But just as doubts of the real value of paper money arise either because being easy to make too much of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold so also doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart someone inquires by what force did Napoleon do this ",
  "As gold is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to historys essential question what is power ",
  "If power be the collective will of the people transferred to their ruler was Pugach\u00ebv a representative of the will of the people ",
  "If not then why was Napoleon I ",
  "Why was Napoleon III a criminal when he was taken prisoner at Boulogne and why later on were those criminals whom he arrested ",
  "Do palace revolutions in which sometimes only two or three people take part transfer the will of the people to a new ruler ?",
  "In international relations is the will of the people also transferred to their conqueror ",
  "Was the will of the Confederation of the Rhine transferred to Napoleon in 1806 ",
  "Was the will of the Russian people transferred to Napoleon in 1809 when our army in alliance with the French went to fight the Austrians ",
  "If the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth freedom and enlightenment of the people how is it that Louis XIV and Iv\u00e1n the Terrible end their reigns tranquilly while Louis XVI and Charles I are executed by their people ",
  "But why did it not react on Louis XIV or on Louis XV why should it react just on Louis XVI ",
  "And what is the time limit for such reactions ",
  "But in that case if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves what significance have those leaders ",
  "Is the ferment of the peoples of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward explained by the activity of Louis XIV XV and XVI their mistresses and ministers and by the lives of Napoleon Rousseau Diderot Beaumarchais and others ?",
  "Is the movement of the Russian people eastward to Kaz\u00e1n and Siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of Iv\u00e1n the Terrible and by his correspondence with K\u00farbski ?",
  "Is the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained by the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis es and their ladies ",
  "What causes historical events ",
  "What is power ?",
  "Under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person ",
  "How is it that millions of men commit collective crimes make war commit murder and so on ",
  "With the present complex forms of political and social life in Europe can any event that is not prescribed decreed or ordered by monarchs ministers parliaments or newspapers be imagined ",
  "Is there any collective action which cannot find its justification in political unity in patriotism in the balance of power or in civilization ",
  "Arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to these two essential questions of history  1 What is power ",
  "What force produces the movement of the nations ?",
  "What is sin the conception of which arises from the consciousness of mans freedom ",
  "What is mans responsibility to society the conception of which results from the conception of freedom ",
  "What is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom ",
  "How should the past life of nations and of humanity be regarded as the result of the free or as the result of the constrained activity of man ?",
  "Can I lift my arm ",
  "I lift it but ask myself could I have abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed "
