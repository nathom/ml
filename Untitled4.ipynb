      "“Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the\n",
      "Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war,\n",
      "if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that\n",
      "Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing\n",
      "more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my\n",
      "‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I\n",
      "have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna\n",
      "Schérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna.\n",
      "With these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high\n",
      "rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna\n",
      "Pávlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering\n",
      "from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used\n",
      "only by the elite.\n",
      "\n",
      "All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered\n",
      "by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the\n",
      "prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,\n",
      "I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette\n",
      "Schérer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not in the\n",
      "least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an\n",
      "embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on\n",
      "his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that\n",
      "refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and\n",
      "with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance\n",
      "who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna,\n",
      "kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,\n",
      "and complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "“First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s\n",
      "mind at rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the\n",
      "politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony\n",
      "could be discerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times\n",
      "like these if one has any feeling?” said Anna Pávlovna. “You are\n",
      "staying the whole evening, I hope?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I\n",
      "must put in an appearance there,” said the prince. “My daughter is\n",
      "coming for me to take me there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought today’s fete had been canceled. I confess all these\n",
      "festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have\n",
      "been put off,” said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force\n",
      "of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev’s\n",
      "dispatch? You know everything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What can one say about it?” replied the prince in a cold, listless\n",
      "tone. “What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has\n",
      "burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale\n",
      "part. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her forty years,\n",
      "overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had\n",
      "become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not\n",
      "feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the\n",
      "expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it\n",
      "did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,\n",
      "as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,\n",
      "which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to\n",
      "correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pávlovna burst\n",
      "out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don’t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don’t understand\n",
      "things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She\n",
      "is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign\n",
      "recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one\n",
      "thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform\n",
      "the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will\n",
      "not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of\n",
      "revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of\n",
      "this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just\n",
      "one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial\n",
      "spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander’s\n",
      "loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to\n",
      "find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer\n",
      "did Novosíltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot\n",
      "understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for\n",
      "himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they\n",
      "promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not\n",
      "perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and\n",
      "that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don’t believe a\n",
      "word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian\n",
      "neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty\n",
      "destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think,” said the prince with a smile, “that if you had been\n",
      "sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King\n",
      "of Prussia’s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me\n",
      "a cup of tea?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In a moment. À propos,” she added, becoming calm again, “I am\n",
      "expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who\n",
      "is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best\n",
      "French families. He is one of the genuine émigrés, the good ones. And\n",

      "\n",
      "“I shall be delighted to meet them,” said the prince. “But\n",
      "tell me,” he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just\n",
      "occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief\n",
      "motive of his visit, “is it true that the Dowager Empress wants\n",
      "Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all\n",
      "accounts is a poor creature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince Vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were\n",
      "trying through the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure it for\n",
      "the baron.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna Pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor\n",

      "pleased with.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her\n",
      "sister,” was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna’s face suddenly assumed an\n",
      "expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with\n",
      "sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious\n",
      "patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke\n",
      "beaucoup d’estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and\n",
      "courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pávlovna\n",
      "wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man\n",
      "recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she\n",
      "said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came\n",
      "out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly\n",
      "beautiful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I often think,” she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer\n",
      "to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political\n",
      "and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate\n",
      "conversation—“I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life\n",
      "are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children?\n",
      "I don’t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don’t like him,” she\n",
      "added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows.\n",
      "“Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than\n",
      "anyone, and so you don’t deserve to have them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And she smiled her ecstatic smile.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“What would you have me do?” he said at last. “You know I did all\n",
      "a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.\n",
      "Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That\n",
      "is the only difference between them.” He said this smiling in a way\n",
      "more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round\n",
      "his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and\n",
      "unpleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a\n",

      "Failed case: With these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception.\n",
      "Failed case: What can one say about it?\n",
      "Failed case: And what little they have promised they will not perform!\n",
      "Failed case: Will you give me a cup of tea?\n",
      "Failed case: He is one of the genuine émigrés, the good ones.\n",
      "Failed case: Between ourselves” (and her face assumed its melancholy expression), “he was mentioned at Her Majesty’s and you were pitied.\n",
      "Failed case: They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I don’t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is very unhappy with her father.\n",
      "Failed case: CHAPTER II  Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room was gradually filling.\n",
      "Failed case: Anna Pávlovna mentioned each one’s name and then left them.\n",
      "Failed case: With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom—which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed—and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pávlovna.\n",
      "Failed case: So you, too, are in the great world?\n",
      "Failed case: I am very sorry to leave your enchanting party,” said he, turning to Anna Pávlovna.\n",
      "Failed case: Before Anna Pávlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomte’s epigram, Pierre again broke into the conversation, and though Anna Pávlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.\n",
      "Failed case: Oh!\n",
      "Failed case: But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.\n",
      "Failed case: Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality.\n",
      "Failed case: So it seems to me.\n",
      "Failed case: She said.\n",
      "Failed case: She went.\n",
      "Failed case: When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, “Opinions are opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am.\n",
      "Failed case: He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naïve question.\n",
      "Failed case: Evidently Pierre’s words touched her to the quick.\n",
      "Failed case: Ah, that is just what I tell him!\n",
      "Failed case: I did indeed.\n",
      "Failed case: Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,” said Prince Andrew.\n",
      "Failed case: Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.\n",
      "Failed case: I see it all!\n",
      "Failed case: Calm yourself, Princess!\n",
      "Failed case: Yes!\n",
      "Failed case: I should like to go to Kurágin’s,” thought he.\n",
      "Failed case: Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet!\n",
      "Failed case: Dólokhov could play all games and nearly always won.\n",
      "Failed case: The bottle of rum was brought.\n",
      "Failed case: Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but could not move it.\n",
      "Failed case: All were silent.\n",
      "Failed case: Anatole did not release him, and though he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating Dólokhov’s words into English.\n",
      "Failed case: Anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light.\n",
      "Failed case: Dólokhov’s back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both sides.\n",
      "Failed case: Suddenly Dólokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge.\n",
      "Failed case: He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly.\n",
      "Failed case: And we’ll take Bruin with us.\n",
      "Failed case: Soon after Anna Pávlovna’s reception Anna Mikháylovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the Rostóvs, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling Bóry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time.\n",
      "Failed case: It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police.\n",
      "Failed case: Prince Vasíli arrived in Moscow yesterday.\n",
      "Failed case: The visitor’s daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room.\n",
      "Failed case: The elders began talking about Bonaparte.\n",
      "Failed case: Look here!\n",
      "Failed case: Natásha,” he said, “you know that I love you, but.\n",
      "Failed case: Don’t, Borís!\n",
      "Failed case: Well, now you’ve done what you wanted,” put in Nicholas—“said unpleasant things to everyone and upset them.\n",
      "Failed case: That lawsuit taught me much.\n",
      "Failed case: When I want to see one of those big people I write a note: ‘Princess So-and-So desires an interview with So and-So,’ and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or four times—till I get what I want.\n",
      "Failed case: Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation.\n",
      "Failed case: But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do anything for his happiness!\n",
      "Failed case: I shall not disturb him, my friend.\n",
      "Failed case: Borís bowed again politely.\n",
      "Failed case: Are you here on leave?\n",
      "Failed case: Let us wait until evening.\n",
      "Failed case: Pierre again asked.\n",
      "Failed case: I never knew any Madame Jacquot.\n",
      "Failed case: Oh dear, what am I thinking about?\n",
      "Failed case: Well, now we know where we are.\n",
      "Failed case: If only Villeneuve doesn’t make a mess of things!\n",
      "Failed case: I will come and spend the night.\n",
      "Failed case: Adieu, ma bonne,” answered Prince Vasíli turning away from her.\n",
      "Failed case: What a sauté of game au madère we are to have, my dear!\n",
      "Failed case: Annette, for heaven’s sake don’t refuse me,” the countess began, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified, elderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief.\n",
      "Failed case: Just consider my own position now, Peter Nikoláevich.\n",
      "Failed case: He could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction.\n",
      "Failed case: Besides that, Peter Nikoláevich, by exchanging into the Guards I shall be in a more prominent position,” continued Berg, “and vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards.\n",
      "Failed case: I suppose it’s very interesting.\n",
      "Failed case: The latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables.\n",
      "Failed case: All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very oldest rose.\n",
      "Failed case: Rhine wine” as the case might be.\n",
      "Failed case: The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to the service and patriotically Russian.\n",
      "Failed case: Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution.\n",
      "Failed case: Natásha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even Márya Dmítrievna.\n",
      "Failed case: Natásha kissed her on the hair.\n",
      "Failed case: I feel so happy!\n",
      "Failed case: What is there to be surprised at?\n",
      "Failed case: Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.\n",
      "Failed case: Outside the house, beyond the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up, waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral.\n",
      "Failed case: Yes, indeed,” replied the princess with a sigh.\n",
      "Failed case: Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,” and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.\n",
      "Failed case: Catherine.\n",
      "Failed case: The only question is, has it been destroyed or not?\n",
      "Failed case: And this is gratitude—this is recognition for those who have sacrificed everything for his sake!\n",
      "Failed case: The princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand.\n",
      "Failed case: I’d better go to my own room.\n",
      "Failed case: Casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the count’s confessor there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing first of one and then of another priest.\n",
      "Failed case: Anna Mikháylovna with just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away from the doctor to Pierre.\n",
      "Failed case: He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning; his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed Pierre.\n",
      "Failed case: He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do), and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on.\n",
      "Failed case: Courage, courage, my friend!\n",
      "Failed case: Into the right hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over from behind the chair, held it in position.\n",
      "Failed case: Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential.\n",
      "Failed case: Once more Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikháylovna to see what he was to do next.\n",
      "Failed case: Dear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him!\n",
      "Failed case: Let go, I tell you!\n",
      "Failed case: Death is awful.\n",
      "Failed case: Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as tears.\n",
      "Failed case: Although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high official appointed to the province in which the prince’s estate lay considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour.\n",
      "Failed case: The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to control himself and not become vehement, but almost always did become vehement, scolded, and sometimes flung the exercise book away.\n",
      "Failed case: It will drive all the nonsense out of your head.\n",
      "Failed case: I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apráksins’.\n",
      "Failed case: It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the army.\n",
      "Failed case: I know you already through my sister-in-law’s friendship for you.\n",
      "Failed case: Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh.\n",
      "Failed case: The two women let go of one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each other’s hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince Andrew’s surprise both began to cry and kissed again.\n",
      "Failed case: The face of the little princess changed.\n",
      "Failed case: Yes, just the same.\n",
      "Failed case: How is your health?\n",
      "Failed case: Why, I have not yet had time to settle down!\n",
      "Failed case: Tíkhon, who ran after him, handing him different articles of clothing.\n",
      "Failed case: Ho, ho!\n",
      "Failed case: He is a great tactician!\n",
      "Failed case: The past always seems good,” said he, “but did not Suvórov himself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know how to escape?\n",
      "Failed case: Consider, Prince Andrew.\n",
      "Failed case: The prince again laughed his frigid laugh.\n",
      "Failed case: And only idlers have failed to beat the Germans.\n",
      "Failed case: I don’t sleep at night.\n",
      "Failed case: The little princess was in her sister-in-law’s room.\n",
      "Failed case: I have a great favor to ask of you.\n",
      "Failed case: If it does not weigh a hundredweight and won’t break my neck.\n",
      "Failed case: She kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa.\n",
      "Failed case: Let us go to her, I must say good-by.\n",
      "Failed case: Thanks, thanks!\n",
      "Failed case: I have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you long as an adjutant: a bad position!\n",
      "Failed case: They stood silent, facing one another.\n",
      "Failed case: But this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian commissariat, and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles.\n",
      "Failed case: Though the aide-de-camp did not know these circumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied.\n",
      "Failed case: On all sides soldiers were running to and fro, throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps over their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms.\n",
      "Failed case: This!\n",
      "Failed case: The commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior, pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this pressure lay his only hope of salvation.\n",
      "Failed case: One says a word to you and you.\n",
      "Failed case: It’s in the Emperor’s service.\n",
      "Failed case: Don’t mention it, General, as if I’d be so bold!\n",
      "Failed case: King of Hearts).\n",
      "Failed case: Zherkóv had met Dólokhov abroad as a private and had not seen fit to recognize him.\n",
      "Failed case: And how have you wriggled onto the staff?\n",
      "Failed case: Your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry, firmness, and expedition.\n",
      "Failed case: Nesvítski noticing Prince Andrew’s pale face and glittering eyes.\n",
      "Failed case: There’s nothing to be gay about,” answered Bolkónski.\n",
      "Failed case: Nesvítski and Zherkóv were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed at Bolkónski silently with wide-open eyes.\n",
      "Failed case: Don’t you understand that either we are officers serving our Tsar and our country, rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely lackeys who care nothing for their master’s business.\n",
      "Failed case: It is all very well for that good-for-nothing fellow      of whom you have made a friend, but not for you, not for      you.\n",
      "Failed case: The squadron in which Nicholas Rostóv served as a cadet was quartered in the German village of Salzeneck.\n",
      "Failed case: Splendid!\n",
      "Failed case: Hurrah for the Russians!\n",
      "Failed case: If we could only get to fighting soon.\n",
      "Failed case: Hullo, who’s there?\n",
      "Failed case: Rostóv took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new coins in separate piles, began counting them.\n",
      "Failed case: Ah!\n",
      "Failed case: I saw you riding this morning.\n",
      "Failed case: I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse,” said Telyánin.\n",
      "Failed case: He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and, evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to write, told Rostóv the contents of his letter.\n",
      "Failed case: Well, what are you standing there for, you sca’cwow?\n",
      "Failed case: No, I remember thinking that you kept it under your head like a treasure,” said Rostóv.\n",
      "Failed case: Wostóv, you’ve not been playing schoolboy twicks.\n",
      "Failed case: The purse is here!\n",
      "Failed case: But Rostóv pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though Denísov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face.\n",
      "Failed case: Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine,” muttered Telyánin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room.\n",
      "Failed case: He told me I lied, and I told him he lied.\n",
      "Failed case: You tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen.\n",
      "Failed case: The staff captain’s voice began to tremble.\n",
      "Failed case: And the staff captain rose and turned away from Rostóv.\n",
      "Failed case: And what has become of that scoundrel?\n",
      "Failed case: I’ve seen him myself!\n",
      "Failed case: We’re going into action, gentlemen!\n",
      "Failed case: Down below, the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of Russian troops.\n",
      "Failed case: But the convoyman took no notice of the word “general” and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking his way.\n",
      "Failed case: Where are you going?\n",
      "Failed case: Nesvítski realized that it was a cannon ball.\n",
      "Failed case: Ah, Váska!\n",
      "Failed case: How’s it you’re not drunk today?\n",
      "Failed case: Perched up there, you’re more like a bird than a man.\n",
      "Failed case: CHAPTER VIII  The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel.\n",
      "Failed case: Denísov rode past him, leaning back and shouting something.\n",
      "Failed case: Another instant and I shall never again see the sun, this water, that gorge!\n",
      "Failed case: So you’ve smelt powdah!\n",
      "Failed case: Denísov.\n",
      "Failed case: In this action for the first time trophies were taken: banners, cannon, and two enemy generals.\n",
      "Failed case: There has been an encounter with Mortier?\n",
      "Failed case: In society he always awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was possible.\n",
      "Failed case: His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original, finished phrases of general interest.\n",
      "Failed case: The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of expression on his face.\n",
      "Failed case: He went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those words in Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.\n",
      "Failed case: Because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of a parade.\n",
      "Failed case: Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic methods that he had better leave Genoa alone?\n",
      "Failed case: It is now my turn to ask you ‘why?\n",
      "Failed case: That’s just it, my dear fellow.\n",
      "Failed case: It’s as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose.\n",
      "Failed case: We heard reports that Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna?\n",
      "Failed case: If not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the new Campo Formio are to be drawn up.\n",
      "Failed case: But the best of it was,” said one, telling of the misfortune of a fellow diplomat, “that the Chancellor told him flatly that his appointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it.\n",
      "Failed case: Where to?\n",
      "Failed case: When speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated,” said Bilíbin, accompanying him to the hall.\n",
      "Failed case: Prince Andrew replied.\n",
      "Failed case: Bilíbin came out to meet him.\n",
      "Failed case: His hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a slight smile he began to examine his nails.\n",
      "Failed case: I am going away.\n",
      "Failed case: And Bilíbin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was insoluble.\n",
      "Failed case: I cannot argue about it,” replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he thought: “I am going to save the army.\n",
      "Failed case: In Brünn everybody attached to the court was packing up, and the heavy baggage was already being dispatched to Olmütz.\n",
      "Failed case: Cette armée russe que l’or de l’Angleterre a transportée des extrémités de l’univers, nous allons lui faire éprouver le même sort—(le sort de l’armée d’Ulm).\n",
      "Failed case: They won’t let us pass, we are left behind and have lost our people.\n",
      "Failed case: Nesvítski.\n",
      "Failed case: But what’s the matter with you?\n",
      "Failed case: Well, all I can make out is that everything is abominable, abominable, quite abominable!\n",
      "Failed case: In the passage little Kozlóvski was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk.\n",
      "Failed case: Kozlóvski’s face looked worn—he too had evidently not slept all night.\n",
      "Failed case: Bagratión, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm, impassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief.\n",
      "Failed case: They talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility; others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement.\n",
      "Failed case: There now, Prince!\n",
      "Failed case: Now you, Captain,” and he turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who without his boots (he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry), in only his stockings, rose when they entered, smiling not altogether comfortably.\n",
      "Failed case: One would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good example, yet here you are without your boots!\n",
      "Failed case: A stout major was pacing up and down the line, and regardless of the screams kept repeating:  “It’s a shame for a soldier to steal; a soldier must be honest, honorable, and brave, but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him, he’s a scoundrel.\n",
      "Failed case: Go on!\n",
      "Failed case: French involuntarily, so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to unload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as quickly as possible.\n",
      "Failed case: Suddenly, however, he was struck by a voice coming from the shed, and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen.\n",
      "Failed case: Prince Andrew turned his horse and galloped back to Grunth to find Prince Bagratión.\n",
      "Failed case: Passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking vodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere the same rapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready, and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his heart.\n",
      "Failed case: Bagratión in reply to the officer’s report, and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before him.\n"
